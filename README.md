# Spotify Loop

A tool that lets you create a playlist that lives in Chrome.

## Why Should You Use This?

- **Organization**: Separate your dynamic playlist from your normal playlists.  
- **Clean UI**: A minimalistic yet functional design similar to Spotifyâ€™s mobile UI.  
- **Instant Access**: Control playback from your browser without switching tabs.  

## Caveats

- Requires Spotify Premium.  
- You need to search for a song to add it.  

## Why I Built It

I often find myself guilty of listening to the same set of five songs and neglecting the two hundred other songs in a playlist. The most obvious solution is to loop over a new playlist, but I wanted a cleaner and more intuitive interface.  

I use this extension regularly, and I hope others also find it useful!

## Future Features

- **Shuffle Button**: Will implement true shuffle functionality.  
- **Add Songs Directly**: Option to add songs directly using the Spotify web app.  
- **Export Playlist**: Export your playlist to Spotify or other formats.

## Want to Try the Extension?

I am currently waiting for a quota extension from Spotify, so if you want to try the extension, feel free to reach out so I can manually add you to the user access list. Otherwise, you can try cloning this repo and setting up an endpoint to generate the client ID and client secret in your config file.
